# Standard: F-on

This format was defined by prize manipulation—you've got *Iron Hands ex*, *Cursed Blast Dusknoir*, *Briar*, and *Overvolt Discharge Magneton*—while games did have a lot of decisions, they were heavily accelerated, especially during ***Shrouded Fable*** meta, by far the worst one I've played. However, *Itchy Pollen Budew* arrived to save the meta from Dusknoir blowouts, so I'm optimistic about the future.

## [Arceus/Armarouge](https://github.com/RituLiot/ptcg-decks/blob/main/Standard/10BRS-TEF/Arceus-Armarouge.md): Trading Blows

This deck presses a lot of buttons for me—it's a toolbox, it promotes two hit-kos from both sides, it pairs together completely unrelated Pokemon, and it utilizes different Pokemon from the same evolution line. You've got the goated *Arceus VSTAR* start that pivots into extra prizes with *Delphox V* or *Iron Hands ex*, and in the end, you deliver a finishing OHKO blow with *Armarouge ex*. Chef's kiss.

## [Regidrago/Ogerpon](https://github.com/RituLiot/ptcg-decks/blob/main/Standard/11BRS-TWM/Regidrago-Ogerpon.md): Finally Playable

I believe *Kyurem*'s release was a mistake that moved *Regidrago VSTAR* into the broken status it was known for in ***SFA*** meta, hence why I'm including this version instead. And this version is so cool! *Regidrago* is a banger of a design that promotes unique deckbuilding decisions, similar to *Phantom Transformation Zoroark* from before. And energy acceleration from *Teal Mask Ogerpon ex* is such a fair and fun way to make this deck function. I'm honestly enamored by how this deck came to be, even if it pushed the power level too far later down the line.
