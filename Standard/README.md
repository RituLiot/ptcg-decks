# Criteria

## Competitiveness
- Tier 0: BDIF, absolutely dominating over the course of the meta.
- Tier 1: One of the best decks in the format, can easily win a tournament.
- Tier 2: Appears in Top 64 or higher. Unlikely to win a tournament, but still can given the right circumstances.
- Tier 3: Appeared in day 2 of a Regional/IC/Worlds at least once.
- Tier 4: Fully functional deck that is missing some of the speed/consistency/versatility of the top decks. Can enter the top competition if the right support cards are printed.
- Tier 5: Semifunctional deck. Either the idea is barely salvagable, the power level is low or its gameplan is incosistent. Can win games on a sunny day.
- Tier F: Unplayable.

## Gameplan
- Aggro: Attacks turn 1 and pressures from there. Strong early game, weak late game.
- Midrange: Ensures to get to a specific board state every turn, starting from second. Strongest in the middle game.
- Accumulate: Gets stronger as the game goes on with slow and steady board improvements. Usually gives up 1-2 prizes in the early game.
- Control: Usually wins by deckout. Can utilize a combination of gameplans below:
  - Disruption: Limits opponent's playing options.
  - Mill: Wins by actively milling opponents every turn.
  - Stall: Wastes time by trapping opponent's support pokemon in active or by hiding behind unbreakable pokemon.

## Difficulty
- Easy: Can be picked up and played close to efficient without too much thought.
- Moderate: Can be understood generally after 1-2 games, yet there are always options to consider for different situations.
- Hard: Requires to consider several lines of play every turn.
- Extreme: Small meaningful optimizations can be found tens of games into playing.


# (OLD) Criteria
FOR E-BLOCK

Decks (or, more broadly, archetypes) are being rated in **competitiveness**, **difficulty** of efficient play and **fun** of play.

## Competitiveness
All decks above C+ tier appeared in day 2 of official tournaments (Regionals, ICs and WCs) at least once.
- **S:**  Best Deck In Format
- **A+:** Won several tournaments, takes up a significant amount of decks in meta.
- **A:**  Won once during format, takes consistent spots in Top8.
- **A-:** Frequent Top8 and Top16, but haven't won just yet.
- **B+:** Made 1-2 appearances in Top8, more in Top16.
- **B:**  Made an appearance in Top16, several in Top32.
- **B-:** Made an appearance in Top64.

All decks in C+ tier and below haven't appeared in day 2 of official tournaments and use SP as a metric. SP stands for Setup+Power and is described below.
- **C+:** SP6, one step away from being meta.
- **C:**  SP5, two steps away from being meta.
- **C-:** SP4, needs additional support from future sets.
- **D+:** SP3, needs severe support from future sets.
- **D:**  SP2, win-rate of 50%.
- **D-:** SP1, win-rate of 30%.
- **E:**  SP0, 10% of the time it works 100% of the time, barely playable.
- **F:**  Unplayable, reserved for biggest stinkers or memes.

Setup is rated 0-3 by the following criteria:
- Setup 3 - deck sets up with meta speed in vast majority of games.
- Setup 2 - deck lags behind one turn behind meta decks OR is inconsistent in a significant number of games.
- Setup 1 - deck lags behind two turns behind meta decks OR is inconsistent in a majority of games.
- Setup 0 - deck can't setup in a timely manner.

Power is rated 0-3 by the following criteria:
- Power 3 - deck keeps up with meta in a prize trade.
- Power 2 - deck loses to meta decks by one prize.
- Power 1 - deck loses to meta decks by two-three prize.
- Power 0 - deck loses to meta decks more than by three prizes.

## Difficulty

Difficulty can be one of the following:
- Easy - you can figure out how this deck works in one-two games.
- Moderate - you'll spend eight-ten games to understand ins and outs of this deck.
- Medium - you'll need good resource management and understand meta trends to play this deck out, but it's not too bad.
- Hard - you'll have to spend **a lot** of time to play this deck to its fullest potential.
- Extreme - *how* do you play this?

## Fun

Fun is subjective, is rated with tiers, and I won't elaborate furher ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.

## Addendum

There's a two-week period when new set releases, but isn't legal for tournament play. These two weeks are unaccounted for in ratings.
