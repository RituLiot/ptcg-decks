All decks were from [Shutterst0ck](https://www.github.com/Shutterst0ck)'s wonderful [repository](https://github.com/Shutterst0ck/SUM-on_TCGLive_Expanded) of Live Expanded decks, with minor tweaks from my side, but that's no longer the case. RIP

Since there's no real meta in the format at the moment, decks (or more specifically, archetypes) are being judged in competitiveness purely by how I think they'd fare in a competitive environment, with possible tiers ranging from S to F:

- **S:** Best Deck in Format
- **A:** Top meta pick.
- **B:** Meta contender.
- **C:** Needs more support or list refinement.
- **D:** Deck is certainly playable, but that's about it.
- **E:** Deck idea itself is questionable and probably would never see competitive success.
- **F:** Unplayable.

I'll also give my thoughts on decks and their practical application.
