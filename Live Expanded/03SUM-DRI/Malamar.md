## Thoughts
This is in no way competitive, and never will be, but it sure is fun and challenging in new ways. My most memorable game was against *Roaring Moon ex*. It was hectic and surprisingly strategic for both sides. I really want to see this idea taken further with more cards similar to *Malamar*. Props to the devs.
